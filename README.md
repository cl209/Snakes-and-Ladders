Snakes and Ladders Game Engine
A C++ implementation of the classic Snakes and Ladders board game engine using a linked list data structure. The project provides both default and randomized board generation with customizable game rules and board configurations.



Key Features:
Dynamic board size with square grid validation
Custom linked list implementation for board representation
Support for two players with turn management
Default and random board generation modes
Automated snake and ladder placement with even distribution
Dice rolling simulation



Technical Highlights:
Memory-safe implementation with proper resource management
Deep copy functionality
Configurable board sizes (minimum 3x3)
Rule enforcement for snake/ladder placement
Comprehensive error handling
Complete movement logic including snake/ladder traversal



Built as part of CMSC 341 (Data Structures) coursework at UMBC.
